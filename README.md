## Features

### BLE Scanning & Analysis

- **Passive BLE scanning** — discovers nearby devices with signal strength (RSSI) and estimated distance
- **Device info extraction** — retrieves names, service UUIDs, manufacturer data, appearance and TX power
- **GATT connections** — connects to devices and reads standard BLE services (Device Info, Battery, Heart Rate, Temperature, Generic Access, Current Time, TX Power, Immediate Alert, Link Loss)
- **Notification capture** — subscribes to notifiable characteristics and decodes live sensor data (Heart Rate, SpO2, Temperature, CSC, RSC, Glucose, Battery)
- **Advertisement interval fingerprinting** — measures time between advertisements for passive device-class identification

### Beacon Detection

- **iBeacon** — parses UUID, major, minor, TX power and estimates distance
- **Eddystone** — decodes all four frame types:
  - **UID** — 16-byte namespace + instance identifier
  - **URL** — leaks raw URLs (internal hostnames, asset tracker URLs)
  - **TLM** — telemetry data (battery voltage, temperature, uptime)
  - **EID** — ephemeral rotating ID (privacy-aware device)
- **PwnBeacon / Pwnagotchi** — detects and reads PwnGrid beacons (identity, face, pwnd counters)

### Privacy Heuristics

- **Rotating MAC detection** — flags devices using Resolvable Private Addresses (RPA)
- **Cleartext detection** — flags devices leaking unencrypted identifiers
- **Exposure classification** — rates devices into tiers (None, Passive, Active, Consent) with a privacy score
- **Live sensor data streaming** — flags devices broadcasting sensor data without authentication

### Security Analysis

- Analyzes writable **BLE characteristics** and access permissions
- Enumerates **DFU** and **UART** services for protocol inspection and diagnostics
- Checks for **encryption** on sensitive services
- Builds **device fingerprints** from advertised UUIDs and GATT profiles
- **Pairing / bonding state detection** — distinguishes open from bonded devices via ATT error codes

### Parsers

- **Manufacturer parser** — 60+ company IDs from Bluetooth Assigned Numbers Section 7
- **Member Service parser** — 100+ member service UUIDs (Section 3.11): Apple, Google, Samsung, Tesla, Xiaomi, Huawei, Garmin, Polar, Bose, Sennheiser, Medtronic, Abbott, Dexcom and more
- **Appearance parser** — full subcategory decoding (190+ entries from Section 2.6): watches, medical devices, domestic appliances, vehicles, industrial tools, cookware and more
- **SDO Service parser** — Section 3.10 special services: Matter (0xFFF6), Zigbee Direct (0xFFF7), ASTM Drone Remote ID (0xFFFA), Thread (0xFFFB), AirFuel (0xFFFC), FIDO U2F (0xFFFD)

### Known Device Detection

- **Flipper Zero** — detected by known service UUIDs
- **CatHack / Apple Juice** — BLE spam tool detection
- **Tesla** — detected via iBeacon UUID, GATT service, and name pattern matching
- **LightBlue** — app-based BLE testing tool
- **Drones** — ASTM Remote ID detection via SDO service UUID 0xFFFA
- **PwnBeacon / Pwnagotchi** — detects and reads PwnGrid beacons (identity, face, pwnd counters, messages)

### Drone Remote ID (ASTM F3411-22a)

When a drone broadcasting Remote ID is detected via BLE service `0xFFFA`:

```
[#3] SDO Match: ASTM Remote ID (ASTM Remote ID)
[#3] ASTM F3411 Remote ID (v2)
   Type:        Helicopter / Multirotor
   Serial:      1ZNDBK20D00089
   Operator ID: DEU-HH-123456
   Status:      Airborne
   Drone GPS:   48.123456, 8.654321
   Alt (geo):   87.5 m
   Alt (baro):  85.0 m
   Height:      42.0 m (above takeoff)
   Speed H:     3.5 m/s
   Speed V:     0.0 m/s
   Heading:     270 deg
   H-Acc:       <10 m

   Description: Delivery drone — authorized flight
```

> Remote ID is mandatory for drones >250g in the EU (2019/947) and US (FAA Part 89)
> since 2023. GhostBLE decodes all six ASTM F3411-22a message types: Basic ID,
> Location, Authentication, Self-ID, System (operator GPS), and Operator ID.

### PwnBeacon

GhostBLE acts as both a PwnBeacon **client** (scanner) and **server** (advertiser), compatible with [PwnBook](https://github.com/pfefferle/PwnBook) and [Palnagotchi](https://github.com/pfefferle/palnagotchi):

- Advertises as a PwnBeacon with SHA-256 fingerprint, identity JSON, face, and device name
- Detects nearby PwnBeacon peers via advertisement service data
- Reads full peer info via GATT (identity, face, name, message)
- Signal/ping characteristic for peer interaction
- Pwnd counters update dynamically during scanning

### Manufacturer Identification

Decodes manufacturer data for Apple, Google, Samsung, Epson, and more. Also parses **iBeacon** advertisements (UUID, major, minor, TX power, distance).

### GPS & Wardriving

- **Dual GPS support** — Grove UART and LoRa cap GPS (Cardputer only for LoRa)
- **WiGLE CSV export** — log devices with location for mapping and analysis
- **GeoJSON export** — RSSI heat map for direct import into QGIS or Google Maps

### Start Wardriving

1. Power on GhostBLE
2. Press `TAB`
3. Select GPS source with `DEL`
   - Grove GPS
   - LoRa GPS
4. Press `BtnG0` to start wardriving

### Web Dashboard

Real-time BLE device discovery via WiFi Access Point and WebSocket:

- **Live device cards** — RSSI signal strength with color coding (green/amber/red), device type tags (CONN, iBeacon, PWN, NOTIFY, SUS)
- **Trace log** — color-coded by category (scan, gatt, security, beacon, notify, privacy)
- **Stats bar** — live counters for Spotted / Suspicious / Beacons / PwnBeacons
- **Device filter** — filter cards by name or MAC address
- **Log replay** — load and replay a recorded `sniffed.log` from SD card into the UI
- **Settings panel** — configure device name, face, WiFi SSID and password
- **Auto-reconnect** — WebSocket reconnects automatically after BLE scan interruptions
- **Display sleep** — display turns off automatically when a web client connects to save resources

### Logging

All findings are logged to multiple channels simultaneously:

| Channel | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Serial** | 115200 baud, structured output |
| **SD card** | Per-category log files (Cardputer only) |
| **Web dashboard** | Real-time via WiFi AP and WebSocket |

Log categories: Scan, GATT, Privacy, Security, Beacon, Control, GPS, System, Target, Notify. Each device gets a **session ID** for cross-log correlation.

### XP System

GhostBLE gamifies the scanning process with experience points:

| Event | XP |
|-------|-----|
| Device discovered | +0.1 |
| GATT connection success | +0.5 |
| Characteristic subscription | +1.0 |
| PwnBeacon detected | +1.0 |
| Notify data (unknown char) | +1.5 |
| Manufacturer data decoded | +2.0 |
| Suspicious device found | +2.0 |
| Known characteristic decoded | +2.5 |
| iBeacon parsed | +3.0 |

XP is persisted to the SD card (Cardputer) and shown on the display with level progression.

### NibBLEs

NibBLEs is the on-screen mascot with context-sensitive expressions and speech bubbles:

- **Expressions** — happy, sad, angry, glasses (detective), thug life, sleeping, hearts, and more
- **Speech bubbles** — context-aware messages for idle, scan start, wardriving, suspicious finds, and level-ups
- **Screenshot capture** — press ENTER on Cardputer to save the current display to SD
- **Display sleep** — NibBLEs pauses animations when a web client is connected

## Architecture

GhostBLE uses a layered architecture with namespaced context objects replacing global variables:

```
src/app/context/
├── scan_context.*      # BLE scan state, device dedup, counters (thread-safe atomics)
├── ui_context.*        # NibBLEs animations, display state, FreeRTOS task handles
├── network_context.*   # WiFi/WebSocket, wardriving, GPS, WiGLE logger
└── device_context.*    # DeviceConfig, XPManager, beacon counters
```

Threading model: BLE scanning runs on Core 1 via FreeRTOS. Variables shared between cores use `std::atomic<>`. UI and network operations run on Core 0 (Arduino loop).
